# AI-project
This project was created with the goal of learning React.js through following online tutorials and watching YouTube videos. As a beginner in React development, I wanted to gain a better understanding of how to build web applications using this popular JavaScript library.
In this repository, you will find the code and files that I have created while following along with various React.js tutorials. Each tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on how to build different features and functionalities using React, and I have taken the time to carefully implement each one to gain a deeper understanding of how React works.

Overall, this GitHub repository serves as a reflection of my journey as a React developer and the progress I have made through self-guided learning. I hope that it can be a helpful resource for others who are also looking to learn React.js through online tutorials and hands-on practice.
